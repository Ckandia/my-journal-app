// Pure, stateless statistics helpers over a rolling window of raw prices for one symbol:
// the counterpart to digitAnalysis.js for the contracts that depend on price movement.
//
// ONE-TICK ANALYSIS. The auto-pilot buys every contract for 1 tick (barrier contracts excepted),
// so the question asked here is "what does the NEXT tick do?", not "where is the drift over the
// last N ticks?". Families kept:
//   - Rise/Fall (CALL/PUT): next-tick direction from the tick-to-tick transition table.
//   - Touch/No Touch, Stays Between/Goes Outside and Ends Between/Outside: barrier contracts, the
//     only ones that run longer. Which side is offered follows the owner's notes: a quiet market
//     favours No Touch / Stays Between / Ends Between, an expanding one favours Touch / Goes Outside /
//     Ends Outside.
// Dropped because Deriv does not sell them at 1 tick (it rejects the buy): Asians (min 5 ticks),
// Only Ups/Downs (min 2), High/Low Tick (fixed 5), Reset Call/Put (min 5).
//
// Every signal is a statistical deviation score, NOT a validated edge or a win probability.
// Deriv's synthetic indices are designed as fair random processes; the numbers describe what the
// last few hundred ticks did, and the learner (frontend) is what checks whether acting on them
// actually paid. Barrier distances are the part most likely to need adjusting against Deriv's
// live validation; the engine now asks Deriv for a price first, so a bad barrier is skipped
// instead of bought.
