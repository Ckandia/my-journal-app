# AI learning layer

**What the AI already did:** read your balance and set stake as a % of it (risk preset), picked the market and contract with the highest signal score, auto-picked a tick duration, and recovered losses with a martingale that flips to the opposite side. It had no memory: every session started from zero.

**What this adds (learning):**
- `src/pages/bulk-trader/learningEngine.ts` records every settled trade per market + contract + duration (1, 2, 5 ticks etc.) and compares its win rate to the break-even rate implied by the real payout.
- It uses that to choose the market, contract and time frame (untried ones get explored, proven ones get preferred).
- Modes in the panel: **Learn** (explore with stakes capped at 25% of base until a combination has 20 trades), **Only trade a proven edge** (needs 30+ trades and a 97.5% lower bound above break-even), **Off**.
- Recovery ladder now stops if the whole ladder would exceed the stop-loss amount.
- `backend/src/learning.js` + `POST /api/learning/outcome`, `GET /api/learning/stats/:profile` keep the results in Neon (table `learning_stats`, created automatically) so learning survives browser clears and Render restarts. Without `DATABASE_URL` it falls back to memory and the browser copy.

**Privacy / Deriv terms:** only aggregate win/loss/stake/profit counts are stored, keyed by a hash of the login id. No ticks or digit data. Re-check clause 2 of Deriv's API terms if you want to keep these long term.

**Important:** synthetic indices are fair random processes. Learning measures whether anything beats break-even; it cannot create an edge, and martingale does not change the expected result, it only raises the size of a bad run. Test on a demo account. Not run against a live Deriv account or built/type-checked here (no network); run `npm run type-check` and `npm run build` before deploying.

**Deploy:** push, redeploy Render (no new env vars) and Vercel. Check `/health` shows `persistence: true` for Neon.

## Strategy Lab (added)
- `strategyLab.ts`: the "AI: set take profit / stop loss and test" button. It sets limits from evidence (no proven edge -> SL at 1/4 of your cap and TP equal to SL; proven edge -> full cap with TP at 1.5x), never above the cap from your risk preset.
- It then replays 3,000 simulated sessions per learned market/contract/time frame using your observed win rate and payout, and shows TP-hit vs SL-hit vs average result. "More TP than SL hits but still losing" is flagged, because tiny TP with big SL always looks good on hit rate.
- Combine with "Only trade a proven edge" so live trading waits for statistical proof.

## Results in Summary / Transactions / Journal (added)
Every AI trade now appears in the left-hand run panel tabs: contracts in Transactions (grouped under an `ai-<time>` run), totals in Summary, and each buy/win/loss/stop/error line in Journal.

## "Trading is not offered for this duration"
The Journal error now names the contract, market and duration, plus Deriv's own wording. With learning on, that combination is skipped for 6 hours and another is tried instead of stopping. With learning Off it still stops, but tells you which one failed.
If it keeps happening for a contract, fix the allowed list `allowedDurations()` in `learningEngine.ts` for that contract.
Errors elsewhere: read the Journal first (red lines), then the browser console, then Render logs for backend calls (`/api/learning/*`).

## AI Trader tab results (added)
The AI Trader tab now has its own "AI trade results" section (stays after a run stops): every trade with time, market, contract, ticks, stake and P/L, running win/loss/net totals, and an "Activity and errors" log (errors in red, including which duration Deriv refused). "Clear" empties it. The same trades also go to the left run panel (Summary, Transactions, Journal).
Files: `tradeHistory.ts`, `AiAgentPanel.tsx`, `ai-agent-panel.scss`.

## Bulk Trader tab results (added)
Same treatment as the AI Trader: a persistent "Bulk trade results" section (`TradeResults.tsx`) with every trade (time, market, contract, ticks, stake, P/L), win/loss/net totals and an "Activity and errors" log that names the failing contract/market/duration. It stays after a run stops and survives switching tabs (`tradeBus.ts`). Trades also feed the left panel Summary, Transactions and Journal.
Previously an engine error (e.g. a refused duration) silently hid the table; it is now logged.

## Run panel on the AI Trader tab (fix)
The Summary / Transactions / Journal tray is hidden by `show_run_panel` in `src/components/run-panel/run-panel.tsx` on any tab not in its list. Bulk Trades had been added earlier; AI Trader was missing, so the tray only appeared on Bulk Trades. AI_TRADER is now in the list.

## Contract rules + percentage-guided learning (added)
- `contractRules.ts` documents how each contract works in ticks and holds a built-in duration table (Ends Between/Outside = not offered in ticks, so the AI no longer picks it; Only Ups/Downs 2-5; Asians 5-10; digits 1-10; High/Low Tick fixed 5).
- The backend now asks Deriv what is really offered per market (`GET /api/contracts/:symbol`, cached 6h) and the AI uses that live answer over the built-in table. If Deriv doesn't answer, the built-in table is used, and any refused duration is still skipped for 6h.
- The backend collects ticks itself (public feed, 500-tick window) and now also reports the last 25/50/100 ticks (even/odd/over/under %). For digit contracts the AI records results per skew bucket of the last 50 ticks (min <50%, flat 50-60, lean 60-70, strong 70+; stored as e.g. DIGITEVEN@strong), so it finds out from real results whether following or fading a skew pays. The percentages describe what happened; they do not predict the next digit, and the learner will say so if they don't pay.
- Redeploy the backend (Render) as well as the frontend. Still to do: Only Ups/Downs both-side option, auto-flip as a selectable recovery mode, small-balance stake handling, cooldown / daily-limit / journal CSV.

## Connection, phones and pooling (added)
- `derivClient.ts`: 25s keep-alive ping, automatic reconnect (5 tries, fresh login URL each time) and re-subscription of live feeds/open contracts. A contract that settled during a drop is reported again as sold. If a buy was in flight when the socket dropped, the Journal says to check Transactions. "Lost connection" now shows only if all reconnects fail.
- `wakeLock.ts`: keeps the phone screen on while an AI or bulk run is active (Android Chrome, iOS Safari 16.4+). Strategies run inside the browser tab, so a locked phone can still pause them: keep the tab open and in front.
- Add to home screen: `public/manifest.webmanifest`, icons in `public/assets/`, tags in `index.html`. Android Chrome: menu > Install app. iOS Safari: Share > Add to Home Screen.
- Learning is pooled across markets (`ALL|contract|duration`), old per-market data is merged automatically.
- Not tested on real phones or against live Deriv; run `npm run type-check` and `npm run build`.

## Burst bulk trades + recovery modes (added)
- Bulk Trades "FIRE ALL AT ONCE (BURST)" (on by default): the NO. OF BULK TRADES contracts are all bought together when Start is pressed (concurrent chunks of 10), not one after another. MAX ENTRY TICKS (default 3, max 5) is the slippage cap: if that many ticks pass before all buys are sent, the rest are NOT sent. The Journal and results then show how many entry ticks and last digits the burst ended up with. The panel shows the total stake of the burst before you press Start; the burst also trims itself to what the balance can cover.
- Both Sides starts both bursts in the same instant. Note: Even + Odd (or Rise + Fall) on the same tick always has exactly one winner, so the pair loses the house margin each time.
- AI Trader "After a loss": Martingale (same side, bigger stake, default), Auto-flip (opposite side, bigger stake) or Flat (no recovery). Auto-flip is no longer hard-coded.
- Still to do: small-balance handling, cooldown / daily limit / journal CSV, Only Ups/Downs pair option.

## Martingale fix + fixed time frame (added)
- Bug: the small-stake exploration cap in Learn mode (25% of base stake until 20 results) was applied to every trade, including recovery steps, so the stake never grew and the martingale looked broken. It now applies only to the first trade of a ladder, and the Journal says when it is used.
- Recovery trades always stay on the same market (and, in Martingale mode, the same contract) until the ladder ends; the AI only picks a new market after a win or when the ladder stops.
- New "Time frame" selector in the AI Trader: Auto (the AI explores 1-10 ticks, which is why durations vary from trade to trade) or a fixed 1/2/3/5/10 ticks, clamped to what each contract allows.

## 1-tick trading + Deriv pre-check (added)
- **Rule:** every contract is bought for exactly 1 tick, except the barrier contracts (Touch/No Touch, Ends Between/Outside), which use the shortest duration Deriv offers (Touch/No Touch: 5 ticks; Ends Between/Outside is not offered in ticks, so it is never traded). Implemented in one place: `tradeTicks()` in `contractRules.ts`; the engine, the learner and the candidate picker all go through it.
- **Not traded any more:** Asians (min 5 ticks), Only Ups/Downs (min 2), High/Low Tick (fixed 5), Reset Call/Put (min 5). Deriv does not sell these at 1 tick, so they are skipped rather than rejected or stretched past 1 tick. The backend no longer generates signals for them.
- **What the AI trades now:** Even/Odd and Rise/Fall on 1 tick, plus Touch/No Touch at 5 ticks. Digit Over/Under/Matches/Differs were never in the auto-pilot list and still are not.
- **Time frame selector removed** from the AI Trader panel (it could override the 1-tick rule). The learner no longer explores durations; old results stored under other durations are simply not used.
- **Rise/Fall analysis is 1-tick:** `contractAnalysis.js` builds a tick-to-tick transition table (what the next tick did after an up/down tick, counting flat ticks as losses for both sides) instead of picking the strongest N-tick drift.
- **Price first, then buy:** each trade now sends a `proposal` (free) before the `buy`. A bad duration, barrier or stake is caught there, and a quote whose payout is under 1.05x the stake is never bought.
- **Refusals no longer stall the engine:** when Deriv refuses a contract (duration, barrier, market closed, low payout) the combination is skipped for 6 hours (in every learning mode, not only Learn) and the AI searches again. Before, it marked the combination and then went idle. Other errors (balance, stake limits, dropped connection) still stop the session.
- **Waiting is now visible:** if nothing is tradable the Journal says so (before, only edge-gate mode did).
- Tested with a fake Deriv connection and type-checked in isolation; not run against live Deriv. Run `npm run type-check`, `npm run build`, then try on a demo account. Redeploy the backend (Render) as well as the frontend.

## Live balance + the owner's notes (Build.docx) coded into the AI (added)
### Balance fix
- **Cause:** the AI panel took its balance from the stored accounts list saved at login (`DerivWSAccountsService.getStoredAccounts()`), read it once, and never updated it. So it was already old on first load and drifted after every trade, deposit or trade made elsewhere. The running view also added `totalProfit` on top of that old number.
- **Now:** `derivClient.ts` subscribes to Deriv's `balance` stream on the AI's own connection (re-opened after a reconnect), ignores a balance that belongs to another account, and exposes `balanceLive` and `refreshBalance()`. The panel shows the live balance with a "live" / "last known" tag and the account (loginid + type) the AI is really connected to.
- **Account switching:** switching demo/real in the header used to leave the AI's connection on the old account. Now an idle panel reconnects to the new account, a running AI is stopped, and Start refuses to run if the AI's connection and the header disagree.
- **Safety:** Start re-reads the live balance first and will not start without one; the engine stops instead of buying a stake larger than the live balance. Risk-preset numbers (stake, stop loss, take profit) are built from the balance at connect / after a run, not on every tick, so manual edits are not overwritten.

### The notes, as code
- `src/pages/bulk-trader/tradingKnowledge.ts` is the single source of truth: every contract in the notes (how it works, tip, 1-tick vs more-than-1-tick, which are barrier contracts, which market state suits them, and which the AI cannot place yet and why). `contractRules.tradeTicks()` reads the barrier list from it, and the panel shows it under "AI playbook (your notes)".
- **Regime rule (barrier contracts):** quiet / contracting market -> Stays Between, No Touch, Ends Between. Volatile / expanding -> Goes Outside, Touch, Ends Outside. `backend/src/contractAnalysis.js` now also emits Stays Between (`RANGE`) and Goes Outside (`UPORDOWN`).
  - Deriv lists none of Stays Between / Goes Outside / Ends Between / Ends Outside in ticks, so the AI will NOT buy them until Deriv's live rules (`contracts_for`) show a tick duration. In practice the barrier contract it can trade today is Touch / No Touch (5 ticks).
- **Even/Odd streak snap-back:** `backend/src/streakStrategy.js`. Signal only when one parity has run 5+ in a row AND tick speed has slowed (average absolute price change of the last 5 ticks below 0.8x the 20 before). It then bets the opposite parity. Tick speed is measured on price, because Deriv's synthetic indices tick at a fixed interval. The signal is tagged `strategy: 'streak_reversal'`, and the learner records it in its own bucket (`DIGITODD@streak`), apart from ordinary Even/Odd signals.
  - **Honest limit:** last digits are independent draws, so a streak does not change the next digit's odds. This is the owner's rule implemented faithfully, not a proven edge. Use "Only trade a proven edge" mode and let the results decide.
- **Not coded:** Higher/Lower (Deriv sells it under the same CALL/PUT codes as Rise/Fall, so a shared refusal list could switch Rise/Fall off), Accumulators and Multipliers (open-position contracts needing their own monitoring and exit logic). Asians, Only Ups/Downs, High/Low Tick and Reset stay known but are never traded (not offered at 1 tick).
- Keep `STREAK_PLAYBOOK` (frontend) and the constants in `streakStrategy.js` (backend) in step.

## Reverse martingale, switch after 2 losses, risk styles = stake only (added)
- **Reverse martingale is now the default stake method** (`recovery_mode: 'reverse'`). The stake grows only after a WIN, by the "stake growth per win" multiplier, and never above the base stake plus what the current streak has won (so a streak stake is funded by winnings, whatever the payout). After "wins in a row before banking" wins the gain is banked and the stake returns to the base stake. After ANY loss the stake goes straight back to the base stake: it never increases after a loss. Classic martingale and Auto-flip (which raise the stake after a loss) are still in the "Stake method" dropdown if you ever want them.
- **Switch after 2 losses** (`SWITCH_AFTER_LOSSES = 2` in `autoPilotEngine.ts`): after 2 losses in a row the AI immediately takes the best tradable signal that is a DIFFERENT contract (not the one that lost, and not its opposite side), instead of waiting for the market to turn. A win resets the count; after a switch the count starts again, so the next switch needs 2 more losses. If no other contract is tradable the AI carries on and says so in the Journal. It still respects the learning mode (e.g. in "proven edge" mode it only switches to a contract with a proven edge). Works in every stake method. Ladder rows are tagged "switched contract", "win streak" or "flipped".
- **Risk styles change the stake only.** Conservative / Moderate / Aggressive set: base stake % of balance, stake growth per win, wins before banking, stop loss and take profit. They are never an input to market or contract choice, so all three styles trade exactly the same contracts (checked by a test). Presets: stake 1/2/3 %, growth 1.5/1.8/1.9x, bank after 3/3/4 wins, stop loss 10/15/25 %, take profit 15/20/30 %.
- Touch / No Touch is still tradable under every style (you asked for barrier contracts to be allowed longer than 1 tick). Digit Matches/Differs are not in the AI's contract list at all.
- Honest limit: reverse martingale limits how much a bad run can cost, but it does not create an edge. On fair random markets the long-run result is still the house margin.

## The Journal tab, and the AI's self-review (added)
- **New tab "Journal"** (between AI Trader and Tutorials; Tutorials moved from index 5 to 6, via `DBOT_TABS` so nothing else needed changing). It shows every settled contract on the active account: net P&L, win rate, profit factor, expectancy, average R, max drawdown, streaks, Edge Score, equity curve, breakdowns (by contract, market, hour, AI stake step, AI strategy), a P&L calendar, the latest trades and a CSV export. It shows the same live account balance as the page header (client store), and the Summary / Transactions / Journal run panel is now visible on this tab too (`run-panel.tsx`).
- **Where trades come from.** The AI Trader records every settled trade with its own context (strategy, stake step, base stake, stake method, confidence, switched/streak tag) through the new `onSettled` hook. Bulk Trader results are recorded from `tradeBus`. "Sync from Deriv" pulls the account history (`profit_table`, newest first, up to 2000 contracts, stops when a page is already known), which also covers the bot builder and manual trades. Everything is deduplicated by contract id; a Deriv sync never erases the AI's own context. Data is kept per account in this browser (`localStorage`, newest 5000 per account); clearing the browser is recovered with Sync from Deriv (without the AI context).
- **Analytics engine:** `src/pages/journal/core` is LuxAlgo's MIT-licensed `journal-core`, vendored unmodified (licence in the folder and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`). One Deriv contract = a buy at the stake + a sell at what came back, so the journal's P&L equals Deriv's to the cent and the stake is the risk (loss = -1R). The "Trade Journal" / LuxAlgo names and logo are NOT used.
- **AI self-review** (`journal/selfReview.ts`). The AI reads its own trades and judges each market + contract (and each contract across all markets) by average R and its standard error: `losing` (about 95% sure it is below break-even, needs 30+ trades) -> the AI skips it; `lagging` (about 84%) -> ranked lower (confidence x0.6); `winning`; `not proven`; `collecting evidence`. It also reports whether growing the stake helped against flat staking, and whether higher signal confidence led to better results. The engine applies it before every pick (`hooks.gate`), including after a loss when it looks for the opposite side or a different contract; if every tradable contract is a proven loser it waits and buys nothing. The review is logged when a session starts. Switch it off with the checkbox in the AI Trader tab or the Journal tab.
- **Honest limit:** with ~1.9x payouts a combination needs ~52% wins to break even, and telling 50% from a profitable rate takes hundreds of trades, so most combinations stay "not proven" for a long time. In a test with 20 combinations of purely random trades the review blocked none. It finds results that are clearly bad or clearly good; it cannot create an edge.
- Also corrected: the risk acknowledgement in the AI Trader tab still described martingale after losses; it now says reverse martingale increases the stake after wins.
- Not tested against live Deriv: field names in the `profit_table` response (the shortcode is parsed as a fallback for market and contract type). Check the first sync on your account.
